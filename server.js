//hi central grader, not sure if you're gonna see this or not. but i did the api's for post and user. the comments were not really working and honestly this assigment drove me to the brink of insanity.
//i despise handlebars in every way imaginable. the fact that this hw was assigned during a project made me want to really put forth the effort to complete it and get a good grade on both.
//but after working for, honestly too long on this handlebar front end routes, im on the verge of tears and i really cant look at this for another second. if i somehow manage to come back to this at a later time
//tonight, you may not see this message. but if you do, theres a reason. im crying myself to sleep tonight üëç
